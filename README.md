## Research Experiences 
**Cognitive Affective Personality Sciences Lab (_Jan - June 2025_)**
‭- Utilized E-Prime software for programming and running behavioral experiments, specifically gaining familiarity with its interface and basic scripting.
- Developed in-depth understanding of the Attention Network Task (ANT), including its theoretical underpinnings, experimental paradigms, and applications in assessing attentional components (alerting, orienting, executive control).

**Sleep and Psychosocial Adjustment Lab (_May - August 2024_)**
- Designed and executed independent research project exploring the predictive power of insomnia factors for (mal)adaptive behaviors related to self-regulation.
- Conducted varimax-rotated factor analyses and applied logistic and ordinal regressions for individual risk factors and structural equation modeling to analyze  relationships between sleep factors and adaptive behaviors.
- 90 hours of intensive training in advanced statistical modeling techniques using R, Stata, and SAS

## Projects 
### Development and Validation of a Novel Psychometric Method for Alexithymia Evaluation (_May 2025_)
- Designed a new psychometric instrument to assess alexithymia, specifically addressing the self-reporting paradox inherent in existing measures.
- Proposed a multimodal approach, integrating performance-based tasks for - Difficulty Describing Feelings (DDF) and a projective method for Difficulty Identifying Feelings (DIF), to enhance measurement validity and reduce same-method variance.
- Conducted a comprehensive conceptual validation of the proposed instrument, drawing on a detailed literature review of alexithymia's clinical manifestations, assessment history, and theoretical underpinnings.

### Converging Pathways in Alcohol-induced Neurotoxicity: the Interplay of Oxidative Stress, Glucocorticoid Signaling, and Ferroptosis	(_Jan 2025_)
- Comprehensive literature review investigating relevant cellular cascades in alcohol-induced neurotoxicity, specifically detailing the interplay of alcohol metabolism, BBB and mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and glucocorticoid dysregulation.

### Comparative Case Analysis: Facebook's Data Privacy Policy Evolution (_Nov 2025_)
[![Repo Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=yhwang2746&repo=Facebook-Dev-Privacy-Policy-Evolution)](https://github.com/yhwang2746/Facebook-Dev-Privacy-Policy-Evolution.git)
- Conducted comparative case analysis of Facebook's major third-party data incidents (Cambridge Analytica, Cultura Colectiva), producing a 3,000-word technical assessment of vulnerability patterns and incident response strategies. 
- Engineered a Natural Language Processing pipeline using scikit-learn to analyze Facebook's Developer Privacy Policy evolution across 7 critical timepoints (2013-2023), implementing TF-IDF vectorization and custom text preprocessing
